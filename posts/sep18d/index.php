                <p class="clear">I did it! Don't know if it was reall necessary, but I did it. I coded my webpage today. I think it looks better than the blog, though it will be a bit more tedious to update. I think I'm still going to use the blog just for ease and update here when I get the chance. Anyways, that was my day.</p>
