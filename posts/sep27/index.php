                <p class="clear">Today's the day the project is due. So I turned it in. Last night was admittedly a late night, ran into a few problems I wasn't expecting. Even still, I forgot   to add some stuff to the final project like the class name and school year, although I didn't notice that until this morning. With the render time my video has, I wasn't going to worry about it. It takes something like four hours to render and I didn't have the time to wait for it like I did when I let it render overnight. So, there's a couple things missing. But I otherwise think it turned out alright.</p>
