                <p class="clear">Now I have to do a Cinemagraph for as a project. It's kind of like a GIF, but instead it uses real video, and only part of the frame is animated instead of the whole thing being in motion. We have to shoot our own video for this project, and I may get the chance to shoot what I want, otherwise I'm going to have to think of something else to do for it. Anyways, this is a proof of concept of my original idea, but this is from a video off of YouTube and not my own shot.</p>

                <p class="clear">So for my idea, I want to do a burnout and freeze the tire, so only dirt and stuff is moving. I don't really have a car that is capable of doing this, but it's rainy outside today. So maybe I'll be able to take our truck out in the mud and get a good shot of a burnout there, which would be pretty cool.</p>
