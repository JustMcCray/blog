                <p class="clear">I'm really terrible at coming up with stuff. I need a bunch of defining thoughts that a person would have that would make them who they are. What I have now are just a bunch of random things any ordinary person might think. I need something deep. Something that would cause someone to pause and think about, but not inspirational thoughts or anything. I need thoughts that show the way a specific person is thinking, and how those thoughts might make up their character traits. I feel like I'm also really not great at explaining stuff too, apparently.</p>
