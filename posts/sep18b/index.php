                <p class="clear">For the animation, I was supposed to upload my storyboard. Forgot to, but here it is anyways.</p>
                <div class="pic1">
                    <img class="img1" src="../../images/storyboard.jpg">
                </div>
                <p class="clear">What does it mean?</p>
                <p class="clear">Well, since I chose a sculpture, it's an actual real three-dimensional object. It was just a matter of finding the typeface that matched closest to the blocks used in the sculpture. Somehow I got lucky and found an almost exact match, or maybe what I'm learning is actually working. I noticed that the valleys in letters like the "W" and "V" were extra indented, the slope got sharper as the sides came together. Aha! This is a print typeface. Searched the web for sans-serif print, looking specifically at the "Q" and "G" because those are pretty unique, and found Univers. Univers LT Std 65 Bold if you really want to be precise.</p>
                <div class="pic1">
                    <img class="img1" src="../../images/profile.jpg">
                </div>
                <p class="clear">Anyways, found the typeface, got all of the letters lined up on the image in Illustrator, (there's only 60 instead of 62 for some reason), and loaded the file into After Effects. From there it was just a simple matter of extruding the text, and voil√†, a three-dimensional project.</p>
                <p class="clear">Back to my storyboard, I wanted to make the camera fly through the letters and have some of the letters have thoughts on them, then in the end, the camera zooms out and the light makes the shadow of the face, and the implication is that your thoughts make you who you are.</p>
               <p class="clear">On to the animation again, flying through the letters wasn't working because I needed to increase the size of the project to make the letters look big to the camera when it was up close, and even though I was working with a vector file, it was pixelating pretty badly up close. So the solution was to go back to Illustrator, make the file really huge, like 130in by 92in huge. That's really big. After importing that file back into AE, I pushed the layer way back in the 3D space so the final framing would be correct. I then extruded the letters again so I had block letters, and additionally being able to have massive letters to fly through.</p>
               <p class="clear">Next was the grueling task of trying to get the shadow right. After trying several hours fiddling with the light in AE and many times referencing the artist's website to get the shadows to line up, I decided it wasn't worth my time because it probably wasn't going to work. Kumi says she only used one light source, but something was just off with my project, probably something about the way AE renders. I'd even gone so far as to measure width and height and depth of the project to make sure all the letters were the same size, but to no avail. Back to Illustrator to draw a whole bunch of shadows.</p>
               <p>Now comes the fun part, animation.</p>
