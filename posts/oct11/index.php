                <p class="clear">The cinemagraph project is due in two days, but I think I've got an appropriate piece to turn in for it. I went out with my brother and my girlfriend to a park on Sunday and we did a little slacklining. The sun was going down and the lighting was pretty decent, so I thought I'd take a few videos with my phone and see if I could use any of them for the project. This is what I finally came up with.</p>

                <p class="clear">I tried doing a video of a burnout in the dirt, but it was hard getting the framing right and getting the tire to stay in the shot because the truck would move forward too fast. Nonetheless, I'm happy with what I finally got for the project.</p>
