                <p class="clear">So, our animation project. Supposed to go through a bunch of books to find designers we like and look at a bunch of their posters, immerse ourselves in design, start to create a library of design and inspiration to pull from.</p>

                <p class="clear">Ooh lookey, one of the books I used. I should have taken more pictures of the other books, instead of just the posters. Anyways, here are some of the posters I liked and thought could be cool animations.</p>

                <p class="clear"> Anyways, those are some of the posters, but this is the one I picked. Turns out it's not really a poster, but a sculpture by a Kumi Yamashita.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="clear">I thought it was pretty cool and figured I could make a neat animation with it. So far it's working out alright. We'll see how the end product is.</p>
